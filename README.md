## Problem
Making capture the flag challenges can be difficult as it involves using a number of programs in order to generate the desired challenge.

## Proposal
I propose a single solution wherein a flag can be specified, steps specified by the user (from a selection offered by the program) and the program will process and generate the desired challenge.

## Goals
At its core, the program would accept a flag, a series of steps, and would generate the challenge from this. Additional stages of development would include a front-end to improve the user's ability to use the program and additional modules to use when designing challenges.

## Features
* Straightforward Framework
* Easy to make new modules
* User-friendly TUI
* Modular System
